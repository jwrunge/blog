# OK: it appears I'll be blogging

Why? Because blogs have had a huge impact on where I've ended up as a developer, and I don't see them becoming any less important. I've gotten a lot out of articles by [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/) and [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/), alongside countless random developers on [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev](https://dev.to) and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com).

Maybe I, too, can be someone else's random developer? Maybe I'm at a point now where what I know and what I've experienced can help someone else? Maybe writing about what I'm doing will help *me* to better organize my thoughts and my work?

Also, I pretty much already blog on my commute home from work each day, out loud or in my head, so it's not like I don't have anything to blog about. I've actually got kind of a daunting list of topics.


## Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineer at [Precision Planting](https://www.precisionplanting.com/), based in Illinois. I work mostly with the frontend, designing and developing the Radicle Agronomics hybrid app that deploys to the web, iOS, and Android. Maybe I'll blog about it sometime?

I've got a hard-working wife, Mary; and two pretty amazing kids: Isaac (4) and Elinor (2). Isaac is our maybe future engineer, and he loves Legos and magnets and anything with a motor; Ellie is the party's healer, providing imaginary band-aids for everyone's imaginary wounds. She also likes pretending to be a dinosaur.

I like Svelte and Capacitor and Rust. I'm learning WebAssembly and wish I knew what I could use Zig for. I think TypeScript is a necessary evil and React is an unnecessary evil.

## So that's a blog post, huh?

Well... it's a start, isn't it? Words on "paper." I'll be more structured when we get hands-on with some code later on. Maybe.
