# OK; it appears I'll be blogging

## Why?

Because blogs have had a huge impact on where I've ended up as a developer, and I don't see them becoming any less important. I've gotten a lot out of posts by [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/) and [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/), alongside countless random developers on [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev](https://dev.to) and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com).

Maybe I, too, can be a random developer? Maybe I'm at a point now where what I know and what I've experienced can help someone else? Maybe writing about what I'm doing will help *me* to better organize my thoughts and my work?

Also, I pretty much already blog on my commute home from work each day, out loud or in my head, so it's not like I don't have anything to blog about.

Also also, I'm working on a few projects, professional and personal, that I think are going to be pretty cool, and I need a place to talk about them.

## Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineer at [Precision Planting](https://www.precisionplanting.com/), based in Illinois. I work mostly with the frontend, designing and developing  the Radicle Agronomics hybrid app that deploys to the web, iOS, and Android. Maybe I'll blog about it sometime?

I've got a hard-working wife, Mary; and two pretty amazing kids: Isaac (4) and Elinor (2). Isaac is our maybe future engineer, and he loves Legos and magnets and anything with a motor; Ellie is the party healer, providing imaginary band-aids for everyone's imaginary wounds.

I like Svelte and Capacitor and Rust. I'm learning WebAssembly and wish I knew what I could use Zig for. I think TypeScript is a necessary evil and React is an unnecessary evil.

## So that's a blog post, huh?

Well... it's a start, isn't it? Words on "paper."

I'll be more structured when we get hands-on with some code later on. I think my first *real* post ought to be some thoughts on JavaScript fatigue, which of course will touch on frameworks and lock-in, React, Sveltekit, and HTMX.

For now, though, I need to figure out where I'm going to host this... [Besides my own portfolio site](https://jacobrunge.com), of course.

Oh yeah, and I'll probably be doing some shameless self-promotion on Twitter/X -- look me up: [@jwrunge](https://twitter.com/jwrunge).
